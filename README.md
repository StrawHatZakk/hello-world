# hello-world
This repository is for practicing the GitHub Flow.
My name is Zakk, I'm following the hello world instructions to learn how to use GitHub.
My ultimate goal with this is creating a version of Pokemon Emerald whith a bunch of
quality of life changes, following pokemon and any other fun features.
I intend to make sure that my version is still fully compatible with the gamecube and
transferring pokemon into gen 4 games. 
The end result should have a save that can transfer back and forth between my copy
and an official copy without complications.
